# Adaptive Computation Time for Recurrent Neural Networks in PyTorch and Tensorflow
We recommend using the TensorFlow implementation, as it is faster and has more tasks implemented. 

To run one of the tasks available tasks with ACT just run:
```
python addition.py
```
or
```
python addition.py
```

To see available options, run:
```
python addition.py -h
```

If you want to apply ACT to your own RNN cell, call ACTCell with your RNN as input. You can see examples in the code for our tasks.

To test the new baseline, run:
```
python addition-repeat.py
```
or
```
python parity-repeat.py
```
