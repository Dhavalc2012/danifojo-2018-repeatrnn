We evaluate the original Adaptive Computation Time model in two of tasks from the original ACT paper: Parity and Addition. We also compared it with our new baseline of repeated inputs. The results were surprising. Our simple network with repeated inputs outperforms ACT in learning speed in these two tasks.
